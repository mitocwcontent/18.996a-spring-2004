### General First Order Simplicity Theory

Wagner, Frank O. _Simple Theories._ Vol. 503. _Mathematics and its Applications._ Dordrecht, NL: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000. ISBN: 0792362217.

The original development appears in the following three readings:

Kim, Byunghan. "Forking in Simple Unstable Theories." _Journal of the London Mathematical Society_ 57, no. 2 (1998): 257–267.

Kim, Byunghan, and Anand Pillay. "Simple Theories." _Annals of Pure and Applied Logic_ 88 (1997): 149–164.

Kim, Byunghan. "A Note on Lascar Strong Types in Simple Theories." _Journal of Symbolic Logic_ 63, no. 3 (1998): 926–936.

### Development of Simplicity in Compact Abstract Theories (without Assuming Thickness or Extension)

Ben-Yaacov, Itay. "Simplicity in Compact Abstract Theories." _Journal of Mathematical Logic_ 3, no. 2 (2003): 163–191.

The development presented in the course is closer to that of Anand Pillay's "Forking in the Category of Existentially Closed Structures." (although the model-theoretic setting is slightly different)
